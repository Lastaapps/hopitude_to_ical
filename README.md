# Hopitude to iCal at TalTech
 
This project aims to convert 
[the timetable](https://app.hopitude.com/en/calendar?cl=66) 
of the subject `Basics of physical movement` at `TalTech` in Tallinn 
into the iCal format, so it can be added to a calendar of your choice. 
The program is written in Rust. 
The project was developed in an evening by Petr Laštovička/LastaApps in 2023.

## Building
Just clone the repo and hit `cargo run` and maybe `cargo install` if you want.

## Available online
I'm also hosting this program on my server. 
The calendar is updated at least once a day. 
You can import the link below into your calendar (see help below). 
If there is an event added, 
the calendar should update automatically withing 2 days from a change. 
If the link is not valid anymore, please file an issue.
